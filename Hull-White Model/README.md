# Hull-White Model
This folder contains the main Hull-White tree model. The test file explains how to price different instruments such as zero coupon bond, coupon bond, caplets/floorlets, swaptions (European/Bermudan) and callable bonds.

For caplets and callable bonds you will need to clone https://github.com/miradulo/isda_daycounters which contains a module to compute fraction year for different ISDA day-count conventions (ACT/360, ACT/365, 30/360, ACT/ACT).
